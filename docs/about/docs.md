# Help build great docs
All members of hackland are encouraged to improve these documents!

These documents are hosted on github and the pages are simple markdown (text) pages. Learning github takes a little effort but is very worthwhile :) You need to set up a github account (if you haven't aready got one) in order to change the docs.

- [github](https://github.com/HakLand/)
- [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) - guide
- [mkdocs.org](http://mkdocs.org) - the markdown pages on github are automatically turned into web pages when they are updated. You don't need to know about this to update the documentation.
